# Iterator: A Coding Blog - Project 3

## A coding ideas and solutions platform

Iterator is an application for developers - professional and student - and anybody interested in the wide wide world of programming to share ideas and solutions in order to tackle the most difficult challenges faced by todayâ€™s developers. The two primary tables in the iterator_db will hold User Profiles and Article Posts: which will allow all users create/update/delete both their profiles and posted articles. This allows for a clean and clear issues/resolution/ideas management solutions platform.
